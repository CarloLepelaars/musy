# How to use

## Note

``` python
from musy import Note
```

The [`Note`](https://CarloLepelaars.github.io/musy/core.html#note) is
the basic building block from which you can create chords and songs.

``` python
c_sharp = Note("C#")
c_sharp
```

    musy.core.Note(note='C#')

Notes can be added and subtracted to form new notes. Each added integer
represents a semitone.

``` python
c_sharp + 1
```

    musy.core.Note(note='D')

``` python
c_sharp - 1
```

    musy.core.Note(note='C')

``` python
c_sharp + 14
```

    musy.core.Note(note='D#')

Intervals can be obtained by comparing a note with a different note or
string.

``` python
c_sharp.interval("F#")
```

    'perfect fourth'

Shorthand is also available for intervals.

``` python
c_sharp.interval("B", short=True)
```

    'b7'

Notes can be converted to its relative major or minor.

``` python
Note("C").minor()
```

    musy.core.Note(note='A')

``` python
Note("C#").major()
```

    musy.core.Note(note='E')

Note methods can be chained together.

``` python
Note("C").minor().major().augment().diminish().diminish()
```

    musy.core.Note(note='B')
